# Optimizing-Agriculture-Production
Agriculture is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops and raising livestock, or in simple words,
It is the process of producing food, fiber and many other desired products by the cultivation of certain plants. 
Agriculture makes us less dependent on other foreign countries as it provides food and also provides income to farmers and revenue to the government. 

We have a dataset that contains the conditions for growing different crops. 
1. N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
2. P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
3. K - ration of Potassium content in soil
4. temperature - temperature in degree Celsius
5. humidity - relative humidity in %
6. ph - ph value of the soil
7. rainfall - rainfall in mm

Now we need to analyze these conditions and form clusters of crops which will help us understand which group of crops require similar kinds of conditions to grow. 

(I will be using K means clustering for this and farm clusters. Then after I analyze the different climatic conditions required for different crops, 
I will perform multiclass classification and will predict which crop can be grown with given climatic conditions.)
